#Input data


# Import pandas under the alias pd
import pandas as pd

# Assign the path to a string variable named data_path
data_path = 'kc_house_data.csv'

# Load the dataset as a dataframe named housing
housing = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Print the price column of housing
print(housing['price'])

# Import numpy and tensorflow with their standard aliases
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Use a numpy array to define price as a 32-bit float
price = np.array(housing['price'], np.float32)

# Define waterfront as a Boolean using cast
waterfront = tf.cast(housing['waterfront'], tf.bool)

# Print price and waterfront
print(price)
print(waterfront)

#Loss functions

# Import the keras module from tensorflow
from tensorflow import keras

# Compute the mean absolute error (mae)
loss = keras.losses.mae(price, predictions)

# Print the mean absolute error (mae)
print(loss.numpy())

# Initialize a variable named scalar
scalar = Variable(1.0, float32)

# Define the model
def model(scalar, features = features):
  	return scalar * features

# Define a loss function
def loss_function(scalar, features = features, targets = targets):
	# Compute the predicted values
	predictions = model(scalar, features)
    
	# Return the mean absolute error loss
	return keras.losses.mae(targets, predictions)

# Evaluate the loss function and print the loss
print(loss_function(scalar).numpy())

#Linear regression
